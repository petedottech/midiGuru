**Welcome to the KORG NTS-1 MIDI controller**

- You've probably already connected your NTS-1 to your computer (either directly via USB or via your MIDI interface), if not, refresh the page and select the interface
- Select the NTS-1's MIDI channel
- Create a new patch
- Add any custom **Oscillators**, **Modulations**, **Reverbs** and **Delays** that you have installed on your NTS-1 using '**Edit**' next to each below (see Korg NTS-1 digital librarian if you aren't sure what you have installed)
- Save and then build your patch!

**Notes:**

1. Currently the patches are saved in your browser, there will be an export/share option coming soon
1. In future it may be possible to read the Oscillator, Modulations, Reverbs and Delays using SysEx, so you won't have to manually add them
1. There is a plan to make a 'no-code' MIDI Controller builder, so you can build controllers/patch editors for any device, stay tuned...
1. It's the first version, if you have any questions or find any issues/bugs please let me know
